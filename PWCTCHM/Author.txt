Hi

My name is Mahmoud Fayed and I lives in Egypt.

I am the Creator of Supernova programming language and I am 
Interesting in Compiler implementation using AI Techniques and 
Supernova is a result of a my researches in this domain.

Supernova is a language tends to be more near to our human language
Where we do programming with fiction desciption using subset of
Pure human language.

The human language is VERY VERY big and contains many words so we use 
A subset of it to **reduce the complexity** of the problem and
to **get acceptable performance** as much as we can.

Unlike other programming languages which is based on statements
Supernova is based on Paragraphs which contains many statements
packed together using ignored words like (the, and,...etc)

For example the two commands:-
	(1) I want window
	(2) Window title is hello.
	May be connected together to form another big statement
	I want window and the window title is hello.
	And a collection of big statements form a paragraph
	And a collection of paragraphs form a program.

Unlike other programming language most of supernova programming
Language statements has a rule describe its structure and help
users to use and remember the statement in the future.

For example the rule :	PVC used to control the structure
			of the statement I Want Window
		Rule : PVC
		[P] = Pronoun
		[V] = Verb
		[C] = Class
		i.e. PVC  = Pronoun Verb   Class		
		Statement =    I  Want  Window follow PVC Rule
		Where:-
		[I] = Pronoun
		[Want] = Verb
		[Window] = Class
		Easy to remember and use !!

	Another rule as example : CAVD used to control the structure
				 of the statement (Window Title is ..Data..)
		Rule : CAVD
		[C] = Class
		[A] = Attribute
		[V] = Verb
		[D] = Data
		i.e. CAVD = Class Attribute Verb Data
		Statement = Window Title is ...data... follow CAVD Rule
		Where:-
		[Window] = Class
		[Title] = Attribute
		[Is] = Verb
		[..Data..] = Data
		Easy to remember and use !!

Supernova is a Multi-language where the source code may be written 
using (Arabic, English, Mixed...etc) code

For example The English program
		I want window and the window title is wow.
	    Can be rewritten in Arabic langauge 
		.«‰« «—Ìœ ‰«›–… Ê«·‰«›–…  Õ  ⁄‰Ê«‰ ÂÊ Ê«Ê

Many other subsets of human languages can be added in the future to
help peoples from different countries and cultures to learn the art
of computer programming at a small age without the need to learn a
Another human language (English) to use a programming language.

With respect to the design of the language and unlike other 
Programming languages which use Context-Free Grammer, Supernova 
Uses a Context-Sensitive Grammer to get a language more near to 
Our human language as much as we can.

Finally Supernova is a Simple Scripting programming language
And released as a Freeware product for MS-Windows.
So if you like it. you can help me by distributing it to your friends.

Any useful feedback are welcome and if you have a question
Please put it in the project forum in sourceforge.net
And i will do my best to help as much as i can.

Have Fun!!
