Fiction Description By Looking To The Future
----------------------------------------------

[1] Knowledge Power

    Supernova know that any variable may exist at any time 
    In the future so you can use any variable without declaration
    And without Assigning a value to it.
    

[2] Expression Power

    Supernova suggest that the initial [x] value is (1) 
    When you write [x] x (5).	

    Supernova suggest that the initial [x] value is (0)
    When you write [x] + (5).

[3] Events Power
 
    There are two types of events allowed 

	1 - Object Events
	    Example : button mouse click event

	        btn1 mouseclick. instructions are
			....instructions here....
		end of instruction
		

	2 - State Events (Event Based on Variable Value)
  	    Example : an Event triggered when x = 10 

		x 10. instructions are
			....instructions here....
		end of instruction

     Supernova look to future and enable us to write events
     before creating objects in the case of Object Events and/or
     before using variables in the case of State Events
