The Basic Context Controlling Rules
-------------------------------------

S -> SI         Rule 1
S -> SPVC       Rule 2
S -> SCAVD	Rule 3	
S -> SDI	Rule 4
S -> SDVD	Rule 5

Since the token is one Character classification ( I, P, V, C, A & D)
is used to manage them

Also there are switches determine the next class
i.e. Classes are context sensitive

1 - I may comes only after S or D  (See Rules 1 and 4)
2 - P may comes only after S (See Rule 2)
3 - V may comes only after P, A or D (See Rules 2,3 and 5)
4 - C may comes only after V or S (See Rules 2 and 3)
5 - A may comes only after C (See Rule 3)

i.e. In the start of tokens classification, the expected token class
is I,P,C or D.

Last accepted class	    	  Next class must be
	S			     I,P,C OR D
	I				 S
	P				 V
	C			       S OR A
	A				 V
	D			      S, I OR V
	V			       C OR D
