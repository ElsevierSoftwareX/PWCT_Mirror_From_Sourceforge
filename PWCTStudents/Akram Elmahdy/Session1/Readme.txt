Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT)

Description

A specialist innovative technology for computer programming designed for computer users to give them 
the ability to create any software they need without previous knowledge of computer programming where 
the user will start to learn how to program and will understand the programming concepts using this
tool step by step and without the need to write code by hand at all where the programming done
through general purpose visual programming languages. 

Unlike other visual programming languages 
PWCT is not limited and target also professional and mainstream programmers by giving them more 
productivity than traditional text-based programming languages. 

PWCT is a Free-Open Source 
Visual Programming Languages Framework to create new General Purpose Visual Programming 
Languages (VPLs) that are a practical alternative to Text based Programming Languages (TPLs).

PWCT comes with four general purpose visual programming languages 
(HarbourPWCT, PythonPWCT, C#PWCT, and SupernovaPWCT)

Features:

    Visual programming languages Framework - Open Architecture - No Limits
    Comes with General Purpose Visual Programming Language
    Coding Simulation Method (Work faster than coding by hand)
    You can use the Time Machine to play software source as movies.
    Practical for programmers (powerful) and expert developers (productive)
    Easy to learn and use (Attract Users)
    Get Max. Readability & Max. Writability together without conflict
    You can See/Edit the source code (Optional)
    Easy to support any text based programming language in the background
    Good Documentation + Many Samples & Movies
    You can create very large/complex software
