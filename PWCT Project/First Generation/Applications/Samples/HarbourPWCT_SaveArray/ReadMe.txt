Hello

Copy Hbmk2.bat & Hbmk2con.bat 
to C:\PWCT19\ssbuild\minigui\BATCH
And accept replacement

The update to the batch files to include the library hbnf that include the functions
ft_savearr()
ft_restarr()

In the next update of PWCT (any release after 2014.11.12) you don't need to do that

Greetings,
Mahmoud
