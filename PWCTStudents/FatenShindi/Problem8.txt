Problem:
Error in building the application

Solution:

1 - Define listbox (Not Editbox)
2 - In procedure myadd, delete step that convert textbox
    content from number to string
    the textbox type is string 
3 - In step win1.text1.additem()
    remove text1 and write list1 (listbox control name)
    determine what the item to add (mytext variable for example)
    win1.list1.additem(mytext)
    in interaction using transporter the variable (mytext) is written
    but the developer forget to set the checkbox (parameters) to True
